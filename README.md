# Name Generator - Day 1

**A simple Python program that combines two names into a single string.**  

## Description
This project is the first in my daily coding journey. It takes two user inputs and generates a combined name — perfect for usernames, brands, or fun nicknames.

**Example:**
Random Name → AI
Suffix → Labs
Output → AILabs
